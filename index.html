    <h1>Ducks, feathery friends</h1>
    <p>Ducks are one of the most common bird families. They exist in almost every country and show several breeds, with diffrientated color, shape...</p>
    <p>Ducks are commonly get as pets even knowing they might have a pretty aggressive character</p>
    <ol>My <strong> personal favorite </strong>are:
        <li>  Mallard Duck <br> <img src="img/MallardDuck.jpg" alt="Mallard Duck" width="150"></a></li> <br>
        <li>White Call Duck <br> <img src="img/WhiteCall.jpg" alt="White Call Duck" width="150"></a></li> <br>
        <li>Swedish Blue Duck <br> <img src="img/SwedishBlue.jpg" alt="Swedish Blue Duck" width="150"></a></li>
    </ol> 
    <br>
    <ul>There are lots of interesting facts about ducks out there, let´s check some of them:
        <li>They´ve got waterproof feathers. That means they can go underwater without getting wet!</li>
        <li>They are omnivourous. They enjoy eating grass, seeds, fruit, fish, seafood...</li>
        <li>Ducks are prepared for water, land and air activities. Isn´t that impressive?!</li>
    </ul>
